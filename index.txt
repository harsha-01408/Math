ALCATRAZ2 - GO GOA GONE
#math #combinatorics #ad-hoc-1 #adhoc

You and 8 friends plan a trip and will pool money together. Some pairs of members have a “cold war”: if one goes, the other won’t. You want to choose a subset of members to maximize the total pooled money, subject to these conflicts.

Input
- One line with 8 space-separated integers: the money each of the 8 members would contribute (members are numbered 1..8 in this order).
- One line with an integer P: the number of conflicting pairs.
- The next P lines each contain two integers u v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ 8), indicating that members u and v cannot both go.

Output
Print a single integer: the maximum total money that can be pooled without selecting any conflicting pair.

Constraints
- All values fit in 32-bit signed integers.

Example
Input:
3 14 5 2 3 4 1 9

1 2

Output:
