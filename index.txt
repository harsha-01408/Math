ALCATRAZ2 - GO GOA GONE
#math #combinatorics #ad-hoc-1 #adhoc

You and 8 friends plan a trip and will pool money together. Some pairs of members have a “cold war”: if one goes, the other won’t. You want to choose a subset of members to maximize the total pooled money, subject to these conflicts.

Input
- One line with 8 space-separated integers: the money each of the 8 members would contribute (members are numbered 1..8 in this order).
- One line with an integer P: the number of conflicting pairs.
- The next P lines each contain two integers u v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ 8), indicating that members u and v cannot both go.

Output
Print a single integer: the maximum total money that can be pooled without selecting any conflicting pair.

Constraints
- All values fit in 32-bit signed integers.

Problem: Lucky Triples

You are given an array a[1..n] of positive integers. Count the number of index triples (i, j, k) such that
  1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n,
  a[i] divides a[j], and
  a[j] divides a[k].

Print the total number of such triples.

Input
- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5).
- The second line contains n integers a1, a2, …, an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6).

Output
- Print a single integer: the number of triples (i, j, k) with i < j < k, a[i] | a[j], and a[j] | a[k].

Notes
- Use 64-bit integer type for the answer (e.g., long long in C++), as the count can be large.
- Values can repeat; equal values are allowed.

Example 1
Input
4

Example 2
Input
6
1 2 3 4 6 12

Output
10
